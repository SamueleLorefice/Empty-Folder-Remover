#Empty folder remover


One Day while unzipping my music collection I fucked-up. My locale was wrong and 3/4 of my music collection were only empty folders with unreadable name. I had already unzipped again with the right locale tho so there was a mix of good folders and bad folders. I had to automatize the process.

And so I made this. Is under MIT license. Is a 32kb single file utility that does multi-threaded directory scan and removal using winAPI for locating empty directories (and this makes it crazy fast).

Maybe I over-engineered this one too much, but. Who cares.
